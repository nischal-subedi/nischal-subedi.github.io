            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the initial blog i would like to start with.</p>
<p>I mostly write on technologies i implement and use on a daily basis. I thought why not have a personal site with blogs inbuilt so this is the full form of that ideation.</p>
<p>Having a blog means online exposure which seems to be a must nowadays and also i get to share my knowledge. I know the feeling of finding a blog article hidden pages behind in a search hit which has the actual solution to a problem you face so i wish to pay it forward and help others who face similar issues with my blog.</p>
<p>I chose docusaurus for this because i had prior experience working with it when writing project documentation and also native dark modeeee.</p>
<p>I'll migrate few of my old blogs from my old site and write some new ones in coming time.</p>]]></content:encoded>
