This is the initial blog i would like to start with.

<!-- truncate -->

I mostly write on technologies i implement and use on a daily basis. I thought why not have a personal site with blogs inbuilt so this is the full form of that ideation.

Having a blog means online exposure which seems to be a must nowadays and also i get to share my knowledge. I know the feeling of finding a blog article hidden pages behind in a search hit which has the actual solution to a problem you face so i wish to pay it forward and help others who face similar issues with my blog.

I chose docusaurus for this because i had prior experience working with it when writing project documentation and also native dark modeeee.

I'll migrate few of my old blogs from my old site and write some new ones in coming time.
